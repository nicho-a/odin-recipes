    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This cheeseburger quesadilla was inspired by one of my favorite burritos from Burrito-Ville, a local joint down
        by Southeast Missouri State University. Burrito-Ville specializes in some of the oddest burritos I've ever
        tasted. From the BBQ chicken burrito to the Buffalo burrito, I've had them all — but they've got only one type
        of quesadilla. So I decided to take one of my favorite burritos from there, the cheeseburger burrito, and apply
        it to quesadilla form. Served with a side of fries and a Coke, I call this my most recent culinary triumph.
        Serve with extra ketchup, mustard, and relish.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
        <li>½ small yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>8 (8 inch) flour tortillas</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Colby cheese</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons ketchup, or to taste</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons yellow mustard, or to taste</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons sweet relish, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in melted butter until slightly tender,
            about 5 minutes. Add ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and garlic powder; cook and stir until
            beef is browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat, drain liquid from beef, and let sit for
            2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, heat a griddle or flat pan over medium heat and spray with cooking spray.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place 1 tortilla on the hot griddle, top with some of the Colby cheese, 1/4 of the beef mixture, 1 teaspoon
            ketchup, 1 teaspoon mustard, and 1 teaspoon relish. Top with more Colby cheese and 1 tortilla. Flatten the
            quesadilla with your hand.
        </li>
        <li>
            Flip quesadilla with a spatula and cook until browned and cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes more. Cut
            quesadilla into 4 pieces. Repeat with remaining tortillas, ground beef, cheese, ketchup, mustard, and
            relish.
        </li>
    </ol>
